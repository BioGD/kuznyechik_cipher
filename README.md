# kuznyechik_cipher
Symmetric encryption algorithm with STR mode of operation
Kuznyechik Algorithm
Description

This repository contains an implementation of the "Kuznyechik" (Kuznyechik) encryption algorithm, which is a standard in Russia. The algorithm is based on a block cipher with a block size of 128 bits and a key length of 256 bits.
Functionality

Encryption and Decryption: Functions for encrypting and decrypting data using the Kuznyechik algorithm are implemented.

Key Support: The algorithm supports 256-bit keys.

Usage Examples: Included code examples demonstrate how to use the algorithm.

Requirements

Programming Language: Rust
